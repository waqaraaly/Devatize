                <p>
                  I'm Waqar, the founder and lead developer behind Devatize. My journey into web development began with a simple goal creating something meaningful while having the flexibility to be present for my family. Over the years, I honed my skills, learning to build websites the right way custom coded, no shortcuts, no cookie-cutter templates.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What I quickly realized was that many small businesses struggled to get a high quality website without breaking the bank. Some were overcharged for outdated designs, while others simply couldn't afford the massive upfront costs. That's why I built a model that works for them affordable, high quality, and risk free.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With ¬£120/month and a "pay only if you love it" approach, I make sure every business gets a website that truly represents them without the financial stress or compromises. No builders, no fluff just pure, handcrafted code tailored to your success.

                  answer: "Our web development process typically takes 2-3 weeks from initial requirement gathering to launch. This includes understanding the founder's vision, conducting competitor research, designing, developing, and making the website live."

                  question: "What are your pricing and payment terms?",

                  answer: "The main difference between the Lump Sum Plan and the Monthly Plan lies in the contract terms and support options. With the Lump Sum Plan, there is no contract required, and you receive full access to the source code. You have the flexibility to either opt for our support and maintenance services at an additional cost of ¬£20 per month or manage support independently if you prefer. On the other hand, the Monthly Plan requires signing a 6-month contract, with support and maintenance services included as part of the plan. This allows you to choose between a one-time payment with optional support or a subscription model with ongoing services."

Our solutions are tailored to help service-based businesses establish a strong online presence and attract more customers."
